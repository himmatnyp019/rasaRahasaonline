        <div class="section-divider"></div>

        <h2 id="section4">4. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect information in a few different ways, always with the goal of providing a secure and efficient service. We are committed to collecting only the data that is necessary for our operations.</p>
        
        <h3>4.1. Information You Provide to Us Directly</h3>
        <p>This is information you knowingly and voluntarily provide when you interact with our Service.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Account Registration Data:</strong> When you create an online account, we collect your <strong>Username</strong> (to identify your account), <strong>Email address</strong> (for authentication, communication, and password resets), and your <strong>Password</strong> (which is immediately encrypted and never stored in plain text).</li>
            <li><strong>Order and Delivery Data:</strong> When you place an order, we collect <strong>Your Full Name</strong>, a precise <strong>Delivery Address</strong> in South Korea, and a <strong>Contact Phone Number</strong>. This is essential for us and our delivery partners to fulfill your order.</li>
            <li><strong>Profile Personalization Data (Optional):</strong> You have the option to upload a <strong>Profile Image</strong>. This is not required to use our service and is used solely for personalizing your account interface.</li>
            <li><strong>Customer Support Communications:</strong> If you contact us via email or phone, we will collect your name, contact information, and the content of your query to provide assistance and maintain a record of our correspondence.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>4.2. Information Related to Your Transactions</h3>
        <p>While we do not handle your sensitive payment details directly, we do collect information about your transactions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Payment Status:</strong> Our system receives a confirmation from our payment partners (PortOne, Kakao Pay) indicating whether a transaction was a <strong>success</strong> or a <strong>failure</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Transaction Records:</strong> We store a record of the products you purchased, the date and time of the transaction, and the order total. This is necessary for order fulfillment, customer support (e.g., returns or issues), and our own financial accounting.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.3. Information Collected Automatically</h3>
        <p>We keep automatic data collection to a minimum to respect your privacy.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Login Time and IP Address:</strong> For security purposes, we log the time, date, and IP address associated with each login to your account. This helps us detect and prevent unauthorized access and protect your account's integrity.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>What We Intentionally DO NOT Collect:</strong>
            <p>To build trust and protect your privacy, we want to be explicit about the data we avoid collecting:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="important">Sensitive Financial Data:</span> We <span class="important">never</span> see, collect, or store your full credit card number, CVV code, or bank account details. This is all handled securely by our payment partners.</li>

                <li><span class="important">Precise Geolocation Data:</span> We do not track your device's real-time location.</li>
                <li><span class="important">Device and Browser Fingerprinting:</span> We do not collect detailed information about your browser version, operating system, plugins, or screen resolution for profiling purposes.</li>

        <p>We work with trusted partners who perform essential functions on our behalf. They are only given access to the information necessary to perform their specific task.</p>

        <h3>6.2. Legal and Law Enforcement Requests</h3>
        <p>We may be required to disclose your Personal Information in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request, if we believe in good faith that the disclosure is required by law and necessary to protect our rights, your safety, or the safety of others.</p>

        <h3>Our Process:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>When you are ready to pay, you are redirected from our website to the secure, encrypted environment of our payment partner (e.g., <strong>PortOne</strong> or <strong>Kakao Pay</strong>).</li>
            <li>You enter your payment details directly into their system. At no point does this information pass through or get stored on our servers.</li>
            <li>They process the transaction and send us a secure notification confirming whether the payment was successful or not, along with a unique transaction identifier.</li>
            <li>We then update your order status in our system based on this notification.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This process ensures that your most sensitive financial data is handled with the highest level of security, in compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).</p>

        <div class="section-divider"></div>

        <h2 id="section8">8. Technology, Cookies, and Analytics</h2>
        <h3>8.1. Our Use of Cookies</h3>
        <p>Cookies are small text files stored on your device. We use them sparingly and only for essential functionality.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Session Cookies:</strong> These are essential for the website to function. For example, they keep track of the items in your shopping cart and keep you logged in as you navigate the site. These are temporary and are deleted when you close your browser.</li>
            <li><strong>Preference Cookies:</strong> We may use cookies to remember certain choices you make (like your preferred language) so you don't have to re-select them on every visit.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="highlight">
            As stated before, <span class="important">we do not use cookies for tracking you across the web or for targeted advertising</span>. You can control or delete cookies through your browser settings, but be aware that disabling essential cookies may impact the functionality of our website.
        </div>
        
        <h3>8.2. Analytics</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Analytics:</strong> We may occasionally use Google Analytics to gather aggregated and anonymized website traffic data. This helps us understand user behavior (e.g., which pages are most visited, how users find our site) in a way that does not personally identify you. This information is used solely to improve our website's performance and user experience. We have configured our Google Analytics implementation to respect user privacy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>8.3. Social Media Integration</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Our website may contain links to our social media pages (e.g., Facebook) or embed content (e.g., YouTube videos). Interacting with these features is governed by the privacy policy of the respective social media company, not this one.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We take our responsibility to protect your information very seriously. We have implemented a multi-layered security strategy that includes technical, administrative, and physical safeguards designed to protect your Personal Information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.</p>
        <h3>9.1. Technical Measures</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Encryption in Transit:</strong> Our website uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) / Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt all data transmitted between your browser and our servers.</li>
            <li><strong>Encryption at Rest:</strong> Your password is not stored in a readable format. It is processed with a strong, one-way cryptographic hashing algorithm (including a "salt") before being stored in our database.</li>
            <li><strong>Firewalls and Network Security:</strong> Our servers are protected by industry-standard firewalls and network security configurations to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>9.2. Organizational Measures</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> Access to Personal Information is strictly limited to authorized RASA RAHASA SDS personnel who have a legitimate business need to access it.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Protection Policies:</strong> We maintain internal policies and procedures to ensure that your data is handled consistently and securely.</li>
            <li><strong>Incident Response Plan:</strong> In the event of a data breach, we have a plan in place to promptly assess the situation, mitigate the impact, and notify affected individuals and relevant authorities as required by South Korean law.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>9.3. Your Responsibility</h3>
        <p>While we do our part, security is a shared responsibility. We urge you to take steps to protect your account, such as using a strong, unique password and logging out after using a shared computer.</p>
        <p>Despite our best efforts, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
